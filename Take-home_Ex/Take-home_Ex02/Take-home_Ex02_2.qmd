# 6 Local Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis

After inferring that the number of dengue cases are not spatially randomly distributed across villages, it would be meaningful to detect clusters and outliers.

To do so, we would conduct local spatial autocorrelation analysis. Local spatial autocorrelation analysis delves deeper than its global counterpart, going beyond the overall pattern to examine spatial relationships at the **individual location level**. It investigates whether a specific location's value is **similar or dissimilar to the values of its surrounding locations**. This provides a more granular and nuanced understanding of spatial clustering or dispersion.

Key points:

-   Focuses on individual locations: It analyzes the relationship between a specific location and its neighbors, providing insights into local patterns that might be obscured in global analysis.

-   Identifies clusters and outliers: It allows identification of spatial clusters of similar or dissimilar values, as well as spatial outliers that deviate significantly from their neighbors.

-   Common statistics: Common local spatial autocorrelation statistics include Local Moran's I and Getis-Ord G statistics. These statistics evaluate local deviations from spatial randomness for each location.

## 6.1: Computing LISA

The first step in performing the local spatial autocorrelation analysis is deriving the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA). The LISA for each observation gives an indication of the extent of significant spatial clustering of similar values around that observation.

To compute LISA, we can apply the following code.

```{r}
#| eval: false
lisa <- wm_q %>% mutate(local_moran = local_moran(
  total_cases, nb, wt, nsim = 79),
  .before = 1) %>%
  unnest(local_moran)
```

Components of code:

-   mutate() from **dplyr** package to create a new column consisting of local_moran's I statistics

-   local_moran() to compute local_moran's I statistics

    -   based on

        -   variable: total cases

        -   number of simulations (79 + 1) = 80

-   unnest() from base R to expand the list-coumn containing the resulting data frame of local moran's I statistics into columns

Output of code (columns):

-   ii: local moran statistic

-   eii: expectation of local moran statistic; for localmoran_perm permutation sample means

-   var_ii: variance of local moran statistic; for localmoran_perm permutation sample standard deviations

-   z_ii: standard deviation of local moran statistic; for localmoran_perm based on permutation sample means and standard deviations

-   p_ii: p-value of local moran statistic using pnorm(); for localmoran_perm using standard deviations based on permutation sample means and standard deviations

-   p_ii_sim: For localmoran_perm(), rank() and punif() of observed statistic rank for \[0, 1\] p-values using alternative hypothesis

-   p_folded_sim: the simulation folded \[0, 0.5\] range ranked p-value (based on https://github.com/pysal/esda/blob/4a63e0b5df1e754b17b5f1205b cadcbecc5e061/esda/crand.py#L211-L213)

-   skewness: For localmoran_perm, the output of e1071::skewness() for the permutation samples underlying the standard deviations

-   kurtosis: For localmoran_perm, the output of e1071::kurtosis() for the permutation samples underlying the standard deviations

## 6.2: Visualizing local Moran's I

Then, we can create a choropleth map using **tmap** functions to visualize the local moran statistic ("ii") of different villages.

```{r}
#| eval: false
tm_shape(lisa) + 
  tm_fill("ii") + 
  tm_borders(alpha=0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Local Moran's I of Total Cases", 
            main.title.size = 0.8)
```

![](images/local%20morans%20i%20of%20total%20cases.png)

Interpreting Local Moran's I ("ii"):

-   Positive: Cluster (village is associated with relatively high values of surrounding villages)

    -   From the choropleth map, we can see quite a number of clusters in the Tainan City, especially more in the northern regions.

-   Negative: Outlier (village is associated with relatively low values of surrounding villages)

    -   From the choropleth map, we can see a small outlier (orange) village that stands out.

But how significant are these clusters and outliers? To discover that, we will have to check their p-values, in the next step!

## 6.3: Visualizing p-value of local's Moran I

Here, we prepare a choropleth map using **tmap** functions to visualize the p-value of local moran statistic ("p_ii_sim"). of the different villages, to detect which villages are significant clusters/outliers.

```{r}
#| eval: false
tm_shape(lisa) +
  tm_fill("p_ii_sim",
          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),
          labels = c("0.001", "0.01", "0.05", "Not significant")) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout (main.title = "p-value of local Moran's I",
             main.title.size = 0.8)
```

![](images/p-value%20of%20local%20morans%20i.png)

From the choropleth map of p-values, we can see that many parts (more than half) of clusters and outliers discovered by the local moran's I statistics are not significant at 95% confidence level. However, there are still a larger number of villages, particularly those in the northern and eastern regions, that exhibit significant clustering/outliers at 95% confidence level.

## 6.4: Visualizing local moran's I and p-value

Putting the local moran's I value and p-value choropleth maps side by side allows to interpret out results more easily, tracing which villages are significant outliers or significant clusters on the map. To do so, we can use tmap_arrange() from **tmap** package to put the maps together, as demonstrated in the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
local_mapi <- tm_shape(lisa) + 
  tm_fill("ii") + 
  tm_borders(alpha=0.5) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Local Moran's I of Total Cases", 
            main.title.size = 0.8)

local_mapp <- tm_shape(lisa) +
  tm_fill("p_ii_sim",
          breaks = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 1),
          labels = c("0.001", "0.01", "0.05", "Not significant")) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_layout (main.title = "p-value of local Moran's I",
             main.title.size = 0.8

tmap_arrange(local_mapi, local_mapp, ncol = 2)
```

![](images/local%20morans%20i.png)

An obvious group of regions that exhibit significant cluster patterns (at 95% confidence level) are the north-western regions of Tainan.

## 6.5 Visualizing LISA map

LISA map is a categorical map showing outliers and clusters. There are two types of outliers namely: High-Low and Low-High outliers. Likewise, there are two type of clusters namely: High-High and Low-Low clusters. In fact, LISA map is an interpreted map by combining local Moran’s I of geographical areas and their respective p-values.

In lisa sf data.frame, we can find three fields contain the LISA categories. They are *mean*, *median* and *pysal*. In general, classification in *mean* will be used as shown in the code chunk below, highlighting only villages that exhibit significant clustering/outliers at 95% confidence level.

```{r}
#| eval: false
lisa_sig <- lisa %>% filter(p_ii <0.05)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
lisa <- readRDS("/Users/binhui-ong/IS415-GAA/Take-home_Ex/Take-home_Ex02/data/rds/lisa.rds")
lisa_sig <- readRDS("/Users/binhui-ong/IS415-GAA/Take-home_Ex/Take-home_Ex02/data/rds/lisa_sig.rds")
```

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(lisa) + 
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_text("VILLENG.x", size = 0.4) +
  tm_shape(lisa_sig) +
  tm_fill("mean") +
  tm_borders(alpha=0.4)
```

Alternatively, to create a static map to see the distribution clearly as a whole,

```{r}
#| eval: false
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(lisa) + 
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_shape(lisa_sig) +
  tm_fill("mean") +
  tm_borders(alpha=0.4)
```

![](images/lisa%20map.png)

The choropleth map tells us that :

-   The north-western and north-eastern regions (in purple) of significant clusters make up of "low-low" clusters, forming clusters of low numbers of dengue cases.

-   On the other hand, some villages in the middle regions (red) make up significant clusters of "high-high" values, implying that they are clusters of high numbers of dengue cases.

-   There are a few villages of "low-high" outliers (purple), showing that they are villages with low numbers of dengue cases, surrounded by villages with higher numbers of dengue cases.

To derive the list of the above villages with significant clusters, we can simply apply the following code.

For High-High clusters (with positive ii) (i.e. clusters with high numbers of dengue cases),

```{r}
lisa_sig %>% filter(ii > 0 & mean == "High-High") %>% select(VILLENG.x)
```

For Low-Low clusters (with positive ii) (i.e. clusters with low numbers of dengue cases),

```{r}
lisa_sig %>% filter(ii > 0 & mean == "Low-Low") %>% select(VILLENG.x)
```

For outliers (with negative ii),

```{r}
lisa_sig %>% filter(ii < 0) %>% select(VILLENG.x, mean)
```

The above outliers are villages with low numbers of dengue cases, surrounded by neighbouring villages with high numbers of dengue cases.

Tadah! We're done with our Local Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis. Let's move on to the next sextion to see how the clusters evolve over time.

# 7 Emerging Hotspot Analysis (EHSA)

Emerging hotspot analysis (EHSA) goes beyond traditional hotspot analysis by **examining how spatial clusters of high or low values evolve over time**. It identifies **areas that are not currently hotspots but display a trend towards becoming one,** providing valuable insights for proactive measures and prevention strategies.

Key points:

-   **Focuses on trends:** Analyzes changes in spatial clusters over time, identifying **emerging hotspots**, **intensifying hotspots**, and **diminishing hotspots** along with persistent and sporadic patterns.

-   **Proactive approach:** Enables proactive measures as it identifies areas exhibiting **early signs of becoming hotspots**, allowing for interventions before the problem escalates.

## 7.1 Preparing spacetime data

### 7.1.1 Data manipulation

To begin with, let's combine our dengue observations based on epidemiology weeks. To do so, we can use group_by() and summarize() from **dplyr** package, and epiweek() from **lubridate** package.

```{r}
#| eval: false
dengue_epi_sf <- dengue_sf %>% 
  group_by(VILLENG, TOWNID, epiweek(發病日)) %>% 
  summarize(cases=n())
```

In the above code,

-   group_by() groups our records according to the fields in the arguments, in ascending order by default, and in order starting with the first field indicated

-   summarize() creates a new field, returning one row of aggregated value for each combination of grouped variables

-   epiweek() extracts the epidemiology weeks of the onset dates (發病日) of each observation

To build a space-time cube later, we can only define one field as the location field. Hence, we will need to create a new location field which is composed of VILLENG and TOWNID, separated by a comma. A new column can be created using mutate() of dplyr package, and the VILLENG and TOWNID fields can be combined using paste() from base R.

```{r}
#| eval: false
dengue_epi_sf <- dengue_epi_sf %>% mutate(location = paste(VILLENG, ",", TOWNID))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
dengue_epi_sf <- readRDS( "/Users/binhui-ong/IS415-GAA/Take-home_Ex/Take-home_Ex02/data/rds/dengue_epi_sf.rds")
```

One of the conditions of building a spacetime cube is that given a number of spatial features (which in this case, is our locations) n, and time periods m, a spatio-temporal full grid must have n X m rows. However, as our existing data only captures actual dengue cases that are recorded, days with 0 cases are not recorded. Therefore, we must insert the records where there are 0 cases by ourselves.

To do so, we can apply the following steps:

#### Step 1: Create a full grid

Applying the code below creates a tibble table that contains our desired complete n x m records.

```{r}
taiwanstudy_sf <- readRDS("/Users/binhui-ong/IS415-GAA/Take-home_Ex/Take-home_Ex02/data/rds/taiwanstudy_sf.rds")
```

```{r}
dengue_full_sf <- tibble(VILLENG = rep(taiwanstudy_sf$VILLENG, 20), 
                         TOWNID = rep(taiwanstudy_sf$TOWNID, 20),
                         geometry = rep(taiwanstudy_sf$geometry, 20),
                        `epiweek(發病日)` = rep(c(31:50), each = 258)) %>%
  mutate(location = paste(VILLENG, "," , TOWNID))
```

In the above code:

-   To fill in values for each column (i.e. VILLENG, TOWNID, geometry and epiweek(發病日)), we can use rep(), a Base R function.

    -   For VILLENG, TOWNID and geometry fields: It replicates the set (vector) of values input in the first argument, for as many times as stated in the second argument throughout the records.

    -   For epiweek(發病日) field: It replicates each individual value in the vector in the first argument for the number of times indicated in the "each" argument, before replicating the next value in the vector the same way, functioning this way throughout all the records.

#### Step 2: Join the existing case records to the full grid

Here, we use left_join() from the **dplyr** package to insert our dengue case records in dengue_epi_sf into dengue_full_sf.

```{r}
dengue_full_sf <- dengue_full_sf %>% left_join(dengue_epi_sf, join_by(VILLENG, TOWNID, `epiweek(發病日)`))  
```

Since we do not need the geometry.y column that is redundant and contains missing values, we can remove it using select() from **dplyr**, and rename geometry.x as geometry since it is our geometry column.

```{r}
dengue_full_sf <- dengue_full_sf %>% select(-geometry.y, -location.y) %>% rename(geometry = geometry.x, location = location.x)
```

```{r}
dengue_full_sf %>% dplyr::arrange(VILLENG)
```

In the above code, I have displayed the records by alphabetical order of VILLNAMEs, for easier visualization here.

We can see that after the data wrangling, we have 5160 records, which corresponds to our 258 villages x 20 epidemiology weeks of observations. Looking into the table, there are some records with NA cases, which represent 0 cases for those corresponding weeks and villages.

#### Step 3: Insert "0" values

Next, we should replace the NA values with 0 to prevent further complications later on, and to make those records appear clearer. To do so, we can use replace_na() from the **tidyr** package.

```{r}
dengue_full_sf$cases <- replace_na(dengue_full_sf$cases, 0)
```

```{r}
dengue_full_sf
```

### 7.1.2 Building space-time cube

Next, we will be building a space-time cube of our dengue data in the study areas of villages in Tainan City, across an epidemiology week of 31-50 in 2023.

Step 1: Prepare geometry data

Let's create a location column, similar to in dengue_epi_sf, in our geometry data taiwanstudy_sf first:

```{r}
taiwanstudy_sf <- taiwanstudy_sf %>% mutate(location = paste(VILLENG, ",", TOWNID))
```

Step 2: Creating spacetime object

Here, we can create our spacetime object using spacetime() from **sfdep**.

```{r}
#| eval: false
dengue_st <- spacetime(dengue_full_sf, taiwanstudy_sf,
         .loc_col = "location",.time_col = "epiweek(發病日)")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
dengue_st <- readRDS( "/Users/binhui-ong/IS415-GAA/Take-home_Ex/Take-home_Ex02/data/rds/dengue_st.rds")
```

```{r}
dengue_st
```

To verify if the result is indeed a spacetime object,

```{r}
is_spacetime(dengue_st)
```

And whether it is a spacetime cube,

```{r}
#| eval: false
is_spacetime_cube(dengue_st)
```

YAY! We've successfully created our spacetime cube, which is a spatio-tempotial full grid.

## 7.2 Computing local Gi\* statistics

### 7.2.1 Deriving spatial weight matrix

Before we can compute local Gi\* statistics, we would need to derive a spatial weight matrix. To do so, we can apply the following code below, using the functions of **sfdep** and **dplyr** packages.

```{r}
#| eval: false
dengue_nb <- dengue_st %>% 
  activate("geometry") %>% 
  mutate(nb = include_self(st_contiguity(geometry)),
         wt = st_inverse_distance(nb, geometry,
                                  scale = 50,
                                  alpha = 1),
         .before = 1) %>%
  set_nbs("nb") %>%
  set_wts("wt")
```

In the code above, activate() from dplyr package is used to activate the geometry context

-   mutate() from **dplyr** package is usd to create two new columns nb and wt

-   set_nbs() and set_wts() are used to activate the data context again and copy the values to each time_slice

-   Now, our dataset has neighbours and weights for each time-slice.

```{r}
#| echo: false
dengue_nb <- readRDS( "/Users/binhui-ong/IS415-GAA/Take-home_Ex/Take-home_Ex02/data/rds/dengue_nb.rds")
```

```{r}
head(dengue_nb)
```

### 7.2.2 Computing Gi\*

Next, we used the derived new columns to manually calculate the local Gi\* for each location.

```{r}
#| eval: false
gi_stars <- dengue_nb %>%
  group_by(`epiweek(發病日)`) %>%
  mutate(gi_star = local_gstar_perm(
    cases, nb, wt)) %>%
  unnest(gi_star)
```

In the above code:

-   group the rows by epiweek(發病日), using group_by() from **dplyr** package

-   create a new column with local_gstar_perm() computations from **sfdep** package

-   unnest gi_star column of the newly created gi_stars data.frame, using unnest() from **tidyr** package

```{r}
#| echo: false
gi_stars <- readRDS("/Users/binhui-ong/IS415-GAA/Take-home_Ex/Take-home_Ex02/data/rds/gi_stars.rds")
```

The result of our code is shown below:

```{r}
gi_stars
```

## 7.3 Mann-Kendall Test

With the Gi\* measures, we can evaluate trends in each village using the Mann-Kendall test. For instance, to evaluate the trend for location Andong Village which has TOWNID D06 (denoted by location = Andong Vil. , D06) we can apply the code chunk below.

```{r}
#| eval: false
andong_mktest <- gi_stars %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(location == "Andong Vil. , D06") %>%
  select(location, `epiweek(發病日)`, gi_star)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
andong_mktest <- readRDS("/Users/binhui-ong/IS415-GAA/Take-home_Ex/Take-home_Ex02/data/rds/andong_mktest.rds")
```

```{r}
andong_mktest
```

Then, we can plot result using **ggplot2** functions to observe the Gi\* statistic across different epidemiology weeks.

```{r}
ggplot(data=andong_mktest,
       aes (x=`epiweek(發病日)`,
            y= gi_star)) + 
         geom_line(color="green") +
  geom_line(y = 0) + 
  geom_line(y = 1.96) + 
  geom_line(y = -1.96)
```

In the above plot, I have also added a reference lines where

-   Gi\* = 0,

-   Gi\* = 1.96 and

-   Gi \* = -1.96.

How should we interpret the Gi\* statistics? The Gi\* statistic returned for each feature in the dataset is a z-score. Since the value of z-score indicates the significance of the result,

-   The more statistically significant positive (**very positive value**) the Gi\*, the more intense the clustering of high values (**hot spot**).

-   The more statistically significant negative (**very negative value**) the Gi\*, the more intense the clustering of low values (**cold spot**).

With that, we will use the positivity or negativity of the Gi\* statistic to determine if it is a hotspot or a coldspot. Then, we should check if Gi\* \> 1.96 or Gi\* \< -1.96 to determine if the hotspot/coldspot is statistically significant at 95% confidence level.

-   Therefore, for Andong Village, it appears that weeks 40 and 46 are epidemiology weeks of significant hotspots! However, in general, there is no trend as the results for most of the other weeks are statistically insignificant at 95% confidence level.

*As there are too many villages, I am unable to display the result for every single village in this website. However, I have created a **ShinyApp** website in which you can select any combination of and compare the **trends of different villages in Tainan City, Taiwan [here](https://binhuiong.shinyapps.io/MannKendall_Tainan/)**!*

Alternatively, rather than creating static plots, we can create an interactive plot using ggplotly() of **plotly** package to plot the Gi\* results.

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = andong_mktest,
            aes(x = `epiweek(發病日)`,
                y = gi_star)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_line(y = 0) + 
  geom_line(y = 1.96) + 
  geom_line(y = -1.96)

ggplotly(p)
```

We can perform the above steps for any village we're interested in!

## 7.4 Performing Emerging Hotspot Analysis (EHSA)

Now... the exciting part! We would be checking which villages exhibit trends!

### 7.4.1 Performing EHSA

To perform EHSA, we can use emerging_hotspot_analysis() from the **sfdep** package.

```{r}
#| echo: false
ehsa <- readRDS("/Users/binhui-ong/IS415-GAA/Take-home_Ex/Take-home_Ex02/data/rds/ehsa.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
ehsa <- emerging_hotspot_analysis(
  x = dengue_st,
  .var = "cases",
  k = 1,
  nsim = 79
)
```

In the code above, the arguments:

-   x is the spacetime object

-   .var is the variable we want to test

-   k = nsim is the last simulations we want to stop run (we start at the 0th simulation)

```{r}
head(ehsa)
```

### 7.4.2 Visualizing the distribution of EHSA classes

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(data = ehsa,
       aes(x=classification)) +
  geom_bar()
```

![](images/ehsa%20class%20dist.png)

From the visualization, it seems like all villages have no pattern detected in terms of distribution. How significant is this result though?

### 7.4.3 Visualizing EHSA

To examine the significance of the conclusion "all villages have no significant trend detected in terms of number of dengue cases", we can visualize the EHSA and it's p-value.

Firstly, we derive the EHSA of each village by using left_join() from the **dplyr** package to insert the EHSA values to each village in our study area.

```{r}
#| eval: false
taiwanstudy_ehsa <- taiwanstudy_sf %>% left_join(ehsa, join_by (location))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
taiwanstudy_ehsa <- readRDS("/Users/binhui-ong/IS415-GAA/Take-home_Ex/Take-home_Ex02/data/rds/taiwanstudy_ehsa.rds")
```

Then, we extract the village records where EHSA are significant.

```{r}
#| echo: false
ehsa_sig <- readRDS("/Users/binhui-ong/IS415-GAA/Take-home_Ex/Take-home_Ex02/data/rds/ehsa_sig.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
ehsa_sig <- taiwanstudy_ehsa %>%
  filter(p_value < 0.05)
```

To create an interactive choropleth map using **tmap** functions, we can apply the code below.

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(taiwanstudy_ehsa) + 
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_text("VILLENG", size = 0.4) +
  tm_shape(ehsa_sig) + 
  tm_fill("classification") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.4)
```

Otherwise, to create a static map, we can use the following code.

```{r}
#| eval: false
tmap_mode("plot")

tm_shape(taiwanstudy_ehsa) + 
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_shape(ehsa_sig) + 
  tm_fill("classification") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.4)+
  tm_text("VILLENG", size = 0.3)
```

![](images/ehsa_sig.png)

In the above codes for creating the maps, we are highlighting only regions that exhibit significance in having "no trend detected". It seems that there are a large number of villages (in turquoise) with no significant trends detected over the epidemiology weeks of 35-50 in year 2023!

On the other hand, the grey villages do not exhibit significance in having "no trend detected" over the epidemiology weeks of 35-50 in year 2023.

# 8 Reflection

This take-home exercise gave me the opportunity to work with real disease data in another country, to hone my skills and deepen my understanding of various types of analyses and statistics to assess the randomess of attributes across geographical regions, detect clusters and outliers and their corresponding significances, and spot regions that are undergoing trends in attributes.

Moreover, it sharpened my skills in data cleaning -- for instance, after some analysis, I faced the problem (and weird issue) of having a village produce different number of dengue cases in the same week. This forced me to backtrack to check on my data cleaning -- and I discovered that there are villages with the same names in Tainan, spread across different regions! This was a good reminder of the importance of understanding the geographical data I am studying.

I hope you enjoyed reading through this work, and gaining insights from the analyses!
